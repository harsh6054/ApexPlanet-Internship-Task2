# PHP Blog CRUD Application with User Authentication

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a **PHP-based Blog Management System** that demonstrates **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations** with **user authentication**. Users can securely register, log in, and manage blog posts through an interactive and user-friendly interface.

The application uses **PHP and MySQL** for backend development and **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for frontend design. Passwords are securely stored using **password hashing**, and **PHP sessions** are used to manage authentication and restrict access to authorized users.

After successful login, users are redirected to the post management page where they can **add, view, edit, and delete blog posts**. A logout option is provided to securely end the session and return to the login page.
